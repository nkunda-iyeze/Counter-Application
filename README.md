https://www.figma.com/file/7CVJuywz7nSIewGSMmHBCm/counter-app?node-id=1%3A4&t=WF32HpqcZjrCy6s9-1

When the user clicks on the reset button the counter should return to it initial value 0
The increment button should increase the counter by 5
the decrement button should decrease the counter by 5

# Hint: use class component. kindly consider adding state and onClick event listener.

# create three functions to handle the reset, increment and decrement.

# Use this.setState to mutate the state object.
